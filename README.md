Practicing usual programs with GUI by PyQT5.

1) First PyQT5 Window.

2) PyQT5 Window + Buttons that print info.

3) PyQT5 Window + Label practice.

4) PyQT5 Window with Images.

5) PyQT5 Window with image, labels, buttons and interaction.

From here on out, I'll use just the .ui file created at QT Designer and import it from the controller.py file.

6) PyQT5 Windows with a manageable list.

7) PyQt Window calling a message box.

8) PyQT Window exploring progress bar.
